    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

    <p>We want you to enjoy every bite. If you’re not completely satisfied with your order, please let us know within 24 hours of delivery so we can make it right.</p>

    <h2>How refunds work</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the issue is with the food (wrong item, missing items, or poor quality), we’ll either replace the order or issue a full refund – whichever you prefer.</li>
        <li>Refunds are processed to the original payment method and typically appear within 3‑5 business days.</li>
        <li>Discounts or promotional codes used on the original purchase are not refundable as cash; they’ll be re‑applied to a future order if you choose a replacement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When we don’t offer refunds</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orders that have been partially consumed or are no longer in their original condition.</li>
        <li>Changes of mind after the 24‑hour window.</li>
        <li>Delivery fees – these are non‑refundable unless the order itself is incorrect or missing.</li>
    </ul>
